Backend developer with a strong background in **C++** and **C#**, gained through over 6 years of experience working on complex game development projects. During this time, I led the creation of robust and scalable systems, focusing on performance optimization, complex algorithms, and software architecture. Currently, Iâ€™m more focused on backend technologies, primarily in the **.NET environment**, leveraging my deep understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and design patterns. I also have experience in frontend development using **React** and **Angular**, which enables me to work across the full stack of a web application. In addition, I am proficient in game development technologies for both PC and mobile platforms, as well as in AR and multiplayer projects.

I have worked with various web development technologies, including **ASP.NET, Node.js, React, Angular, Qt, Unity, Unreal Engine** and **Visual Studio**. I am proficient in relational databases such as **MySQL** and **Microsoft SQL Server**, and I have experience with ORMs like **Entity Framework**. I am also well-versed in C++ libraries such as **OpenGL, SDL2, Bullet** and **Box2D**.

I've had the opportunity to work in teams on several occasions, where I sometimes took on leadership roles, demonstrating my ability to adapt quickly to different contexts and challenges. Additionally, I enjoy multicultural exchange and have successfully collaborated with teams from different countries, which has enriched me both professionally and personally.

If you are interested in expanding your professional network, discussing technologies or collaborating on projects, do not hesitate to contact me.
